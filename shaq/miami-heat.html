<h1>Mami Heat </h1>
<h1><img src="../Images/shaq-heat.png" width="900" height="495" alt=""/></h1>
<p>In 2004 the Lakers traded Shaq to the Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, and Brian Grant, alogn with a first round draft choice, which would later be Jordan Famar. Once Shaq signed with the Heat, he promised to win a championship for Miami. Shaq said that he wanted to be traded to the HEat because of a rising star who went by the name of Dwyane Wade, who Shaq named &quot;The Flash&quot;. They went on to win 59 games, averaged 22.9 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. HE was also elected to his 12th consecutive allstar game. He narrowly lost the MVP vote to Steve Nash that year as well. <br>
  <br>
The following year Shaq would sign a 5 year 100 million dollar extention with the Heat. In the start of the 2005 season Shaq would get hurt and Stan VAn Gundy would resign citing family issues. Pat Riley would then take over. Riley would limit Shaqs minutes to a career low and he would slo average career lows as well Riley wanted to keep Shaq healthy for the playoffs. They did not make the post seaosn. In the 2006 season Shaq and the Heat made it to the Finals against the Mavericks. The Mavericks would dominate the Heat in the first two games. Howeverr the Heat would win the next 3 straight at home, and close out Dallas on the road for his fourth title. Wade carried much of the offense with Shaq averaging 13.7 points, and 10.2 rebounds. <br>
<br>
The following season both Shaq and Wade would get hurt, leaving Shaq to carry the team. The Heat would make it to the first round but would get swept and not advance to the seond round for the first time in Shaqs career.In the 2007 season Shaq would struggle and got into a fued with Riley. This would put a strain on his relationship with his head coach, and as a result he was traded.</p>
