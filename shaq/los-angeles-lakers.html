<h1>Los Angeles Lakers</h1>
<h1><img src="../Images/shaq-lakers.png" width="900" height="495" alt=""/></h1>
<p>Shaq arrived in LA as a free agent in the summer of 1996. In the summer of 1996 Shaq was also named to the Olympic Basketball team where Shaq would help the United States go on to win the gold medal in Atlanta. During this time when Shaq was training with the Olympic team, the Orlando Sentinal published a poll sking if Shaq was worht the 115 million that he was asking for. 91% of people said no. This media reaction along with Hardaway considering himself the leader of the team and didnt want Shaq making more money than him fueled the reasons as to why Shaq left Orlando. He really left on a bad note. He then signed with the Laker for seven years 121 million. Shaq insisted over and over agian that he did not sign there for the money. &quot;I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, and wear Reebok.&quot; In the 1996 season he missed 30 games but still wnet on to average 26.2 points, and 12.5 rebounds. The lakers made the playoffs but were eliminated in the second round. In his first playoff game with the Lakers he scored 46 points. <br>
  <br>
The next season he averaged 28.3 points, and 11.4 rebounds and led the league with a 59.4 field goal percentage which he did for 5 consecutive seasons. The Lakers made the Finals this year but fell to Utah in four games. The next season the Lakers acquired Kobe Bryant and the expectations for winning went up. In a shortened lockout season they made the playoffs but were swept by the Spurs who went on to win the Finals. Then in 1999 the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as a head coach and began a dynasty run. Under Jacksons triangle offense Kobe and Shaq had a lto of success. They led the Lakers to 3 consecutive championships in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Shaq was named Finlas MVP for all 3 and had the highest scoring average in the Finals for centers in history. In 1999 he was also voted MVP and was one vote shy of becoming the first unanimous MVP, which Steph Curry would get this year. <br>
<br>
In the 2001-2002 season Shaq had surgery to correct an issue with his toe. He choose to have a less evasive surgery to come back quicker. The toe would hurt him the whole season and he averaged lower than his career stats with 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds. He didnt want another season of limping so he had the surgery in 2002 and missed a lot of the season due to injury. In the 2003-2004 season Shaq wanted more money from the Lakers which added to the fued between him and Kobe. Kobe heavily critizied Shaq. Desipite this they made the Finals in 2004 but lost to the Pistons. After the season Shaq demanded a trade, due to not getting the raise he wanted.</p>
