<h1>Later Years </h1>
<h1><img src="../Images/shaq-celtics.png" width="900" height="495" alt=""/></h1>
<p>Shaq was traded in the 2007-2008 season to the Phoenix Suns. They swapped Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks for him. With the Suns he would average 12.9 points, while starting all 28 games for them that season. A reason for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the playoffs if the Suns made it. The ended up facing the Spurs, but were eliminated once again. He averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assist in the playoffs. In 2008-2009 Shaq averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks leading the Suns to a second place finish. But in 2009 Shaq didnt make the playoffs for the first time since he was a rookie and was notified he might be traded to cut costs. <br>
  <br>
He was traded in 2009 to the Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic and Ben Wallace. After he was traded he said &quot;My motto is very simple: Win a ring for the King.&quot; He would get hurt in 2009 and return for the playoffs. but would lose in the first round. He would average career lows in every category. <br>
<br>
In 2010 the Celtics signed Shaq but was limited to a substitiution role. In 2011 he tweeted out to his fans &quot;We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. Thats why im telling you first. Im about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.&quot; He held a press conference in Orlando to offically announce his retirement.</p>
