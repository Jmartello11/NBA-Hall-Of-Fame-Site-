<h1>Houston Rockets</h1>
<h1> <img src="../Images/yao-nba.png" width="900" height="495" alt=""/></h1>
<p>The talk of the CBA not allowing Yao to play in the NBA was put to rest after the CBA declared that Yao can play in the NBA. Execpt there was one rule. The Houston Rockets had to take Yao otherwise he did not have permission to play in the NBA. After being assured by the Rockets that they would indeed take Yao with the first overall pick, the CBA granted Yao permission to play. When Yao was picked first verall in 2002 he became the first international player to ever be slected first overall without having previously played U.S college basketball.<br>
  <br>
Yao's firts game was atMiami on December 16, 2002. The Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies at the game. Yao was not angry with this however as he was not familiar with the American sterotypes. He said that he had never seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention. In the following months before Yao played Shaquille O'Neal, Shaq said &quot;Tell Yao Ming, Ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh&quot;. A lot of people saw Shaq's remarks as racist but Shaq said that they were only jokes. In 2003 the NBA offered all star ballots in three languages. English, Spanish, and Chinese. Yao was voted to start for the west over Shaq who had just come off of 3 consectuive NBA Finals MVP awards. Yao became the first rookie to star the game since Grant Hill in 1995. Yao finished his rookie season averaging 13.5 rebounds per game, and was second in NBA Rookie of the Year voting next to Amare Stoudemire.<br>
<br>
The next year coach Jeff Van Gundy was broght in and Yao averaged career highs in both points and rebounds. He was once again voted to be the starting center for the west in the all star game. Yao finished his second season with 17.5 points and 9.0 rebounds per game. They also made the playoffs for the first time in his career, where he averaged 15.0 points and 7.4 rebounds.<br>
<br>
In 2004 the Rockets acquired Track McGrady and the Rockets were seen as title contenders. Both McGrady and Yao were voted to the allstar game, where Yao broke Jordans record for alls tar votes with 2,558,278. The Rockets made the playoffs again in 2004 but ended up losing to the Mavericks. He ended up averaging 21.5 points along with 7.7 rebounds. <br>
<br>
In his first 3 years in the NBA Yao only missed 2 games. The following years up unitl 2008 Yao was hurt with multiple foot, back, and knee injuries. In his fourth season after playing in only 57 games, he averaged 22.3 points, and 10.2 rebounds. They did not make the playoffs that year. The following year in 2005 Yao brokoe his knee and was averaging 26.8 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks per game until that point. <br>
<br>
In the 2008 season his first full season since 2004 he averaged 19.7 points, and 9.9 rebounds. The Rockets made the Playoffs and made it pass the first round to play the Lakers in the second round. The Rockets would lose to the Lakers and Yao would suffer another foot injury. This injury would make him miss the entire 2009-2010 season. In the 2010-2011 season Yao's playing time was limited and he ended up suffering yet another stress fractuere and was forced to miss the rest of the season. In 2011 he became a free ageent and retired from basketball.<br>
<br>
He finished his NBA career averaging 19.0 points per game, 1.9 blocks per game and 9.2 rebounds per game.</p>
